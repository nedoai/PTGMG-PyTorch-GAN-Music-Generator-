## Project Description

Welcome to PTGMG (PyTorch-GAN-Music-Generator), a captivating project that leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create mesmerizing audio files. Our primary objective is to craft harmonious melodies that are not just random compositions, but rather music that resonates with context and emotion. When training the model, remember the profound impact that context can have on the generated music.

Explore the intricate interplay of algorithms and artistry, and dive into the depths of musical creativity. The potential of PTGMG extends beyond traditional boundaries, opening doors to novel compositions that reflect the synergy of technology and imagination.

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to provide clarity and simplicity, allowing you to delve into the magic of music generation effortlessly. The repository is organized as follows:

- **`/audio and descriptions`**: This directory contains the datasets used to train the GAN model. It's the foundation upon which musical dreams are built.

- **`/models`**: Models can't be upload here, (2 gb), but i can load link. I post this link in my tg channel

## Stay In Tune

Stay updated with the latest harmonies and developments by joining our Telegram News channel: [@nedoainews](https://t.me/nedoainews).

Unleash your inner composer and embark on a sonic adventure with PTGMG. Let the melodies flow, the algorithms harmonize, and the music transcend.

## How to use?

Run fit_model_with_save_points (recomended).py. Start training the model. Then if you need to add more data for better generation - run fine-tune-model-trans-method.py or fine_tune.py (fine-tune-model-trans-method.py) - should make it sound better (not exact). If you don't want to bother with additional training - test_with_prompt.py for tests. 

Also install the following libraries:

pip install librosa soundfile torchtext torch numpy (if torchtext is not working - install torchtext==0.6.0)
